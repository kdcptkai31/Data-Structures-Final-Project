# Data-Structures-Final-Project
This was our final project in C++ Data Structures, the program was developed on github @ https://github.com/djreisch/CS1D-Project2 however the owner of the repo has it labeled as private, so I am re-uploading it here.
## Development
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate proficiency with data structures while using **Agile** and following the **Scrum process**. Although we had used Waffle.io for our Kanban board purposes, all Scrum and documents and procedures are located in the **documents** folder. Documents include User Stories, Test Plan, Scrumlog, coding standards, and a Big O analysis of our traversal algorithms. IDE used was Qt for our GUI.
## Features
The program built a **SQL database** of every major baseball statium in the United States, as well as their offered souvenirs. The user selects the desired statiums to visit, as well as the starting statium, and using **Dijkstra's algorithm** the most efficient path is calculated, followed by the user "traveling" to each stadium and given the oppurtunity to purchase items.
Additionally, all data is presented to the user allowing them to sort or modify data through our GUI.
